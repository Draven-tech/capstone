# 🚨 EMSCall: Your Lifeline in Emergencies 🚨

**EMSCall** is a revolutionary emergency response app designed to bridge the critical gap between citizens in distress and the dedicated responders who can help—police, fire, ambulance, and even traffic enforcers (CITOM). In those vital moments when every second counts, EMSCall empowers you to reach the right help fast, securely, and reliably.

## 🎯 Purpose

In the Philippines, emergencies often become chaotic—people may panic, crowd around, or even take videos instead of calling for help. **EMSCall** simplifies this confusion by putting a direct line to trusted emergency responders right in your hand, leveraging technology and real-world authentication for verified calls and faster response.

## 🛠️ Features

### 📱 Citizen Side
- 📋 **User Registration**: Includes personal info, selfie (for face verification), and SIM card number (leveraging the SIM Card Registration Act).
- 📞 **Direct Emergency Calling**: One-tap selection of emergency responders (police, fire, ambulance, CITOM).
- 🧠 **Verification**: Before calls go through, users verify identity using:
  - Face recognition (selfie)
  - SIM number verification (via telecom API, if feasible)
- 🌐 **Free Data Support**: Leverages "free data" feature (like Facebook Messenger) for basic emergency messaging even without load.
- 🚨 **Nearby Incident Alerts**: Users can opt-in to receive nearby emergency alerts within a 10km radius.

### 🚓 Responder Side
- 🔔 **Emergency Alerts**: NDRRMC-style loud alerts for responders within 10km of the incident.
- 📍 **Citizen Data**: View verified caller data (name, photo, phone number, location) to prioritize real emergencies.
- 🗺️ **Location-based Response**: Map-based incident location for faster deployment.
